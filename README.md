## 🧠 Learning Outcomes  
Through this project, I enhanced my **front-end development skills** and explored how to create interactive user experiences using pure **JavaScript**.  
I learned how to:  
- Build **dynamic UI components** (typing effects, popups, and theme toggles)  
- Use **localStorage** to maintain user preferences  
- Validate and enhance **form inputs**  
- Improve **user engagement** through small animations and humor  
- Write **cleaner, modular code** with reusable functions  

This assignment helped me understand how to transform static HTML pages into **engaging, user-friendly interfaces**.
