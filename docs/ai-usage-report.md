# **AI Usage Report – HW2**

## **Tools Used**  
For Homework 2, I continued using **ChatGPT** as my main AI assistant to further develop and enhance my personal portfolio website. This phase focused on implementing more **interactive features**, improving **code structure**, and refining **user experience**.  

The AI tool helped me build new features including:
- A **dynamic typing greeting** that loops between motivational sentences.
- A **personalized name input** that updates greetings instantly and stores data in localStorage.
- An **email validation system** that checks for proper format and provides domain suggestions such as *@gmail.com* and *@hotmail.com*.
- A **funny “message sent” popup** that makes the user experience more engaging.
- A **scroll-to-top arrow** for better navigation.
- A **dark/light theme toggle** that remembers user preference.

Beyond coding, ChatGPT also guided me in refactoring JavaScript to avoid lag, improving animation timing, and writing cleaner and more efficient CSS.

## **Benefits**  
Using AI in this stage provided me with both technical and creative advantages.  
It helped me:
- Understand how to manage **DOM events and animations** efficiently.  
- Learn **modular JavaScript design** by organizing code into reusable functions.  
- Master **UI feedback systems** (popups, smooth scrolls, transitions).  
- Implement **data persistence** using localStorage for theme and user information.  
- Enhance the **overall polish and interactivity** of the website with less trial and error.  

Working alongside ChatGPT accelerated my learning curve in web development. I now have a stronger grasp of combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create cohesive, responsive, and fun user interfaces.

## **Challenges**  
While AI support was helpful, it also required careful oversight. Some of the suggestions were either **too complex** or caused **performance issues**, such as lag in the typing animation or duplicated intervals when changing names.  
To solve these, I had to:
- Rework the animation logic for better performance.  
- Add resets and condition checks to avoid overlapping timers.  
- Simplify CSS transitions and avoid redundant declarations.  

This experience reinforced the importance of **debugging and testing** even with AI-generated code. I learned that understanding why something works is more valuable than simply copying it.

## **Learning Outcomes**  
Throughout this phase, I achieved several key learning outcomes:
- I became confident in **validating form inputs** using regular expressions (regex).  
- I learned how to manage **UI states** effectively with event listeners and localStorage.  
- I improved my ability to **refactor and debug** JavaScript for better performance.  
- I developed a sense of **user-centered design**, focusing on accessibility, readability, and engagement.  

Most importantly, I gained the habit of thinking like both a **developer** and a **designer** — building features that are not only functional but also enjoyable to use.

## **Responsible Use**  
I used ChatGPT responsibly by treating it as a **mentor and coding assistant**, not as a replacement for learning. Every suggestion was reviewed, tested, and customized to fit the project’s purpose.  
The AI accelerated the workflow but never took away my personal contribution or creativity. Each piece of code was written with understanding and intent, ensuring that the final result truly represented **my own learning progress and technical growth**.

## **Reflection**  
This project phase demonstrated the true power of human–AI collaboration. AI provided the tools and ideas, while I provided the direction, decision-making, and creativity.  
By balancing both, I was able to create a **smarter, smoother, and more dynamic** portfolio website that reflects not just technical ability, but also adaptability and a continuous learning mindset.
