# AI Usage Report

## Tools Used  
I used **ChatGPT** throughout the development of my personal portfolio website to assist with generating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. The tool was particularly helpful in providing creative design features such as the typing effect for my tagline, hover animations on project cards, and the dark/light theme toggle. It also supported me in debugging layout issues and improving responsiveness across devices.  

## Benefits  
One of the main benefits of using AI was that it saved me time by generating boilerplate structures, such as the base HTML layout and reusable CSS components. It also introduced me to new design techniques, including animations, accessibility practices, and responsive grid layouts, which enhanced both the functionality and the user experience of my portfolio. Beyond coding, ChatGPT’s explanations accelerated my learning process and gave me a deeper understanding of the connections between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  

## Challenges  
However, there were also challenges. Some of the AI’s suggestions were overly complex or caused layout issues when implemented directly. For example, the initial version of the typing effect animation was too advanced and needed to be simplified for better readability and performance. This meant I had to carefully refine and adapt the AI-generated code, testing it thoroughly to ensure that it aligned with my project requirements.  

## Learning Outcomes  
Through this process, I gained confidence in my ability to critically evaluate AI outputs. I learned to decide what to keep, what to adapt, and what to discard, instead of relying blindly on the tool. As a result, my portfolio became cleaner, more responsive, and more interactive, while still reflecting my own coding decisions and creativity.  

## Responsible Use  
Finally, I made sure to use AI responsibly. I treated ChatGPT as a support tool rather than a replacement for my own learning. Every suggestion was modified, tested, and verified to ensure accuracy and alignment with my goals. This approach allowed me to enhance creativity, improve problem-solving, and build a project that truly reflects my skills.
